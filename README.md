# MSA Plotly Graphs

This repo contains Plotly graphs hosted on GitHub Pages and embedded on several pages on the Market Shaping Accelerator and CGD websites. It also holds an initial draft of text for an MSA page, though the published version contains changes not reflected here.

The graphs are live on the following pages and should not be changed without verifying there's no impact:

- [Pull Incentive Sizing Tool](https://www.marketshapingaccelerator.org/pull-incentive-sizing-tool/)
- [How Big Should a Pull Incentive Be? (MSA)](https://www.marketshapingaccelerator.org/research/how-big-should-a-pull-incentive-be-a-new-pull-incentive-sizing-tool-to-foster-innovation/)
- [How Big Should a Pull Incentive Be? (CGD)](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/how-big-should-pull-incentive-be-new-pull-incentive-sizing-tool-foster-innovation)
