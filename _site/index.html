<h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Funders using pull mechanisms face a crucial practical question: how large of an incentive should they offer? This guide provides a practical framework for answering that question, breaking down the complex factors that determine the optimal incentive size to attract serious development efforts.</p>

<p><span class="tooltip-word">Pull mechanisms<span class="tooltip-text">“Pull funding” is incentive-based funding that rewards firms after achieving specific results or delivering a successful product. Since funders do not pay upfront, pull mechanisms place risk of technological success on the innovators.</span></span> are funding tools that pay for successful outcomes. Unlike push funding, which pays for research inputs upfront, pull funding only pays out when specified goals are achieved - for instance, when a working technology is demonstrated or a product reaches the market. Pull mechanisms, which include prizes and <span class="tooltip-word">advance market commitments<span class="tooltip-text">Advanced market commitments are agreements where governments or organizations commit to purchasing or subsidizing a product once it is successfully developed, guaranteeing a market for manufacturers.</span></span>, thus require the innovator to bear the costs and risks of developing the target technology.</p>

<p>The framework in this piece focuses on providing an assessible guide to size pull mechanisms. Our approach draws from our experience evaluating incentive programs across sectors and builds on literature about pull incentives starting with <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211103">Ahuja et. al 2021</a> and  <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2021.4163">Kremer, Levin and Snyder 2022 </a>, among others.  While this approach continues to evolve as we learn from new applications, we believe it provides a useful starting point for funders considering pull mechanisms. The framework helps funders systematically assess development costs, technical risks, and market dynamics to determine appropriate incentive levels. For technical teams, we provide detailed mathematical models and real-world examples showing how to apply these principles to specific cases.</p>

<p>By breaking the sizing problem into a series of manageable steps, we aim to help funders and program designers develop more cost-effective and efficient innovation incentives. We begin with a conceptual framework for analyzing firm participation in pull mechanisms (<a href="#conceptual_framework">Section 2</a>), then examine how to estimate the key components of firms’ costs and risks when pursuing innovation (<a href="#understanding_costs">Section 3</a>). Building on this foundation, we show how to determine optimal program size by analyzing incentives needed for different target probabilities of success (<a href="program_size">Section 4</a>). We then discuss how to evaluate cost-effectiveness and assess total program costs (<a href="total_costs">Section 5</a>). The appendix provides a detailed <a href="#complete_example">case study</a> of sizing an advance market commitment for methane-reducing livestock vaccines and extends our framework analysis to address important considerations like multiple attempts within firms and correlated probabilities of success.</p>

<h2 id="conceptual_framework">2. Conceptual Framework</h2>

<p><span class="tooltip-word">Pull mechanisms<span class="tooltip-text">“Pull incentives” are incentive-based funding that rewards firms after achieving specific results or delivering a successful product. Since funders do not pay upfront, pull mechanisms place risk of technological success on the innovators.</span></span> mimic market incentives by committing to reward innovators of socially valuable goods. At first approximation, when firms evaluate whether to enter a market, they consider whether expected revenues will exceed expected costs. To answer that question, firms need to assess: What is the likelihood of technological success? How much will it cost to pursue innovation? What is the expected market size and timing of future revenue? And how much competition do they expect to face?</p>

<p>The size and structure of the <span class="tooltip-word">pull mechanism<span class="tooltip-text">“Pull incentives” are incentive-based funding that rewards firms after achieving specific results or delivering a successful product. Since funders do not pay upfront, pull mechanisms place risk of technological success on the innovators.</span></span> will dictate the answer to these questions and, hence, determine how many firms try their hand at innovation. Increasing the amount of effort firms put into innovation or increasing the expected number of firms that choose to participate in pull mechanisms increases the probability that at least one attempt yields success. To determine the appropriate reward size, the designer of the <span class="tooltip-word">pull mechanism<span class="tooltip-text">“Pull incentives” are incentive-based funding that rewards firms after achieving specific results or delivering a successful product. Since funders do not pay upfront, pull mechanisms place risk of technological success on the innovators.</span></span>, therefore, needs to consider the tradeoff between increasing the probability that firms succeed at innovation and the cost of the pull mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="model_setup">a. Model Setup</h3>
<p>When designing an innovation incentive, we need a systematic way to think about what motivates firms to participate. Let’s start with a simplified view.</p>

<p>Imagine a pharmaceutical company considering whether to develop a new vaccine. They know development will require significant upfront investment in research, clinical trials, and manufacturing capacity. They also know there’s a high chance of failure at each stage, and that other companies might succeed first.</p>

<p>To decide whether to invest, firms weigh their expected costs against potential rewards. If successful, they’ll receive the incentive payment — but they might have to share it with other successful developers. If they fail, they bear all the costs with no return.</p>

<p>Our framework captures this decision-making process. We look at:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The full cost of development, from research through commercialization </li>
    <li>The probability of success at each stage of innovation </li>
    <li>The time value of money between when costs are incurred and payments are received </li>
    <li>The impact of competition on expected returns </li>
</ul>

<p>From the funder’s perspective, the optimal size of the pull mechanism depends on the number of firms they want to entice to invest in the target innovation. Hence, our model captures the estimated number of firms that a funder would expect to invest based on the size of the incentive offered.</p>

<p>To make this analysis tractable, we make some simplifying assumptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All firms are rational and risk-neutral: they participate if (and only if) expected benefits exceed costs. </li>
    <li>Firms face one choice: whether to invest in a single innovation attempt. All firms make this decision and progress on research on the same timetable. </li>
    <li>All innovation attempts are <span class="tooltip-word">identical<span class="tooltip-text">By identical, we mean that each attempt has the same probability of success, not that they are all pursuing the same method or approach</span></span> and <span class="tooltip-word">independent<span class="tooltip-text">By independence, we mean that each attempt is uncorrelated with any other attempt, much like how whether a flipped coin comes up heads does not depend on the outcome of the previous flip. We relax this assumption later by allowing different attempts to become correlated with each other</span></span>.</li>
    <li>Successful firms share the reward <span class="tooltip-word">equally<span class="tooltip-text">For example, if only one firm succeeds, they receive the entire award. If two firms succeed, they each receive half the reward</span></span>.</li>
    <li>Benefits do not depend on the number of successful firms. The goal of the funder is to ensure that at least one firm is successful. </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Throughout this post, we use “firm” to refer to any profit-motivated innovator - whether a large company, research institution, startup, or university spinoff.</em></p>

<h2 id="understanding_costs">3. Understanding Innovation Costs and Risks</h2>
<h3 id="key_components">a. Key components</h3>
<p>First, we need to understand the costs and risks that firms incur when trying to innovate. The higher the cost of innovation, the larger the pull size needs to be in order for firms to find investing in innovation worthwhile. Account for the following elements:</p>

<p><strong>i. Cost of R&amp;D and commercialization.</strong> This category includes the fixed and marginal costs to a firm to invent, produce, and deliver the desired product. Costs associated with identifying promising leads, validating their efficacy, testing their safety, shepherding through regulatory approval, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing the final good all fall under this category.</p>

<p><button class="see-more-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('rdcosts-details')">Show example</button></p>
<div id="rdcosts-details" class="details-box">
    <p>
    For example, consider an AMC to incentivize the development of a livestock vaccine. We can use past data on livestock vaccine innovations to inform our estimates on the cost of development. The following comes from a 2014 paper estimating the costs to develop a vaccine for chicken in 2009. Any forward-looking estimates would need to adjust for inflation.

<p><strong>ii. Likelihood of technological success.</strong> Innovation is inherently risky. There is no guarantee that firms that incur R&amp;D and commercialization costs will succeed in developing an innovation and bringing it to market. The probability of success includes a firm’s risk of technological failure such that they are unable to fulfill the terms of the technical product parameters.</p>

<p>Since estimates of success rates vary substantially, designers should be careful that the data source for success rates and costs are consistent. Some sources may estimate a higher success rate because they exclude earlier stages. Or they may estimate the success rate of an entire research program, which includes multiple concurrent attempts, resulting in both a higher success rate but also a higher cost. These alternative approaches are not wrong, but one needs to be careful that the costs and success rates represent the same activities.</p>

<p><strong>iii. Firm’s hurdle rate of return.</strong> Firms expect to make a profit and, all else equal, prefer investments that pay money today rather than in the future. Since pull mechanisms require firms to spend money in the present in the hope of future payment, firms will not participate unless adequately compensated for that delay. In general, the more a funder wishes to delay payments (e.g. the technology requires many years to develop and commercialize), the greater the premium the funder must pay to induce entry. MSA currently uses annual discount rates of 8-10%, depending on the sector involved. For long-dated AMCs, i.e. AMCs for technological innovations that may take ten years or more to pay off, including discount rates can more than double nominal costs.</p>

<p><button class="see-more-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('discountratesizing-details')">How discounting affects AMC sizing</button></p>
<div id="discountratesizing-details" class="details-box">


Suppose, a firm has a 10% hurdle rate. If the payout is delayed ten years, then the funder will need to pay \$259 in year 10 to induce \$100 in private spending in year 0.

Formally, if $r$ is the firm hurdle rate and $t$ is the number of years between upfront payment, the nominal value of  the pull commitment to induce \$1 in spending is $$(1+r)^t$$.

<h3 id="prospective_costs">b. Calculating Firms' Prospective Costs</h3>

<p>Innovation often requires multiple steps, including research and development, testing, trials, and regulatory approval. Each step incurs its own set of costs and its own risk of failure. However, firms do not incur all costs upfront. Instead, if the project fails at any stage, the firm simply stops and does not incur the costs of subsequent stages.</p>

<p>When sizing the pull mechanism, we consider the firm’s perspective at the time of entry — the “prospective cost,” not the total cost of a successful innovation. The prospective costs faced by the firm at the time of entry are the cumulative, probability-weighted costs across all development phases, properly discounted for the time value of money.</p>

<p>For example, a livestock vaccine might have an all-in development cost of <span>$</span>3.4 million, but the investment in an early-stage vaccine candidate in R&amp;D would have a prospective cost of <span>$</span>1.8 million because if the vaccine fails during R&amp;D, the later costs of testing and approval are not incurred (see drop down example for more detail).</p>

<p><button class="see-more-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('optionvalue-details')">Walking through an example</button></p>
<div id="optionvalue-details" class="details-box">

Research and development is typically a staged process in which your idea may fail at any given step, allowing one to terminate the process. Let us say the following: k is the number of innovation steps, and P is a vector representing the probability of advancing from one stage to the next where $P = \{p_0,p_1,p_2, ... , p_k\}$. Let $C$ be a vector representing the cost at each stage $C = \{c_0,c_1,c_2, ... , c_k\}$.

Without consideration of the time value of money, the cost of development is $$\sum_{i=1}^{k} c_i \prod_{j=1}^{i} p_{j-1}$$


Consider the case of the vaccine considered previously. We first need to decompose into annual costs and probabilities of failure so we can calculate expected costs.

While the all-in cost of running from start to finish is \$3.4 million, because the innovator stops incurring costs upon failure, the expected cost at time of initiation is only \$1.9 million.


We now need to introduce the time value of money. Discounting reduces future costs, as firms value expenses incurred in the future less than they value expenses they incur in the present. For example, if we use an 8.05% discount rate (from <a href="https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/wacc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Damadoran 2024</a>), we get the following table for our livestock vaccine modeling.

Since the overwhelming majority of the costs fall in the first few years, discounting only reduces all-in costs from \$1.9 million to \$1.8 million. For human vaccines, where Stage III trials can get extremely expensive, this discounting can have a major effect on the present value of the incentive.
</div>

<p>We use the prospective cost of the innovation attempt to be able to compare to the present value of the expected reward from the pull incentive, which is also discounted by time and the probability of success. That is, we are estimating the expected costs and returns from the firm’s perspective at the time of entry.</p>

<h3 id="sourcing_parameters">c. Sourcing Parameter Estimates</h3>
<p>Data on the costs and risks of innovation can be difficult to find, but there are several types of sources we have found useful for gathering this information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><span class="tooltip-word">Academic literature<span class="tooltip-text">One example: <a href="https://curis.ku.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/106806762/IFRO_Report_227.pdf">DiMasi, Grabowski and Hansen 2016</a></span></span> and industry reports provide historical cost averages </li>
    <li>Government and regulatory filings often contain detailed development costs </li>
    <li>Interviews with industry experts who can validate cost assumptions</li>
    <li>Similar completed projects that provide comparable reference points</li>
</ul>

<p>When using these sources, it is important to be aware of their potential limitations and biases. Published costs often only represent successful attempts. They may also be dated and need adjustment for inflation. Additionally, costs can vary significantly by sector, region, and specific technical challenges. Triangulating between multiple sources can provide a more complete picture.</p>

<p>Additionally, remember that we’re trying to identify the threshold case — the point at which firms are just willing to participate. Firms with lower costs or higher probabilities of success than our estimates will find participation attractive, while those with higher costs or lower chances of success will not participate.</p>

<h2 id="program_size">4. Determining the Overall Program Size</h2>

<p>We now have a framework for calculating the expected costs firms face when pursuing innovation. How, then, do we use this to determine the total size of the pull incentive needed?</p>

<p>First, consider perhaps the simplest case: aiming to set an incentive size large enough to motivate one firm to attempt innovation. To accomplish this, the pull incentive needs to provide an expected reward greater than or equal to a firm’s prospective cost of an innovation attempt.  In the case of a singular firm, the probability of receiving the pull incentive payout is the same as the probability of innovation success (we will discuss competition risk in the next section).  Therefore, the present value of the pull incentive would equal the firm’s prospective costs multiplied by the reciprocal of their probability of success.</p>

<p>For example, for a livestock vaccine with a firm’s prospective cost of <span>$</span>1.8 million and a 2.7% chance of success, a pull incentive would need to have a present value of <span>$</span>66.7 million. While it may be shocking that <span>$</span>66.7 million is more than an order of magnitude larger firm’s prospective costs, remember that pull mechanisms are shifting the risks of development from the funder to the innovator. In this case, rather than the funder giving a <span>$</span>1.8 million grant up front with only a 2.7% chance of successful innovation, the funder commits to paying <span>$</span>66.7 million only if the innovation is successful. The funder has a 2.7% chance of paying <span>$</span>66.7 million; in the 97.3% of times the innovator is unsuccessful, the funder can repurpose those funds for other projects.</p>

<p>In many cases, the funder may want to create a pull fund that is large enough to incentivize multiple attempts simultaneously in order to have a higher probability of at least one successful innovation. In the next section, we discuss how to choose the target number of attempts.</p>

<h3 id="number_of_attempts">a. Target Number of Attempts</h3>

<p>The key is to recognize that each additional firm attempting innovation increases the overall chances of success. Consider a case where any individual firm has a 10% chance of successfully developing a targeted product. If two firms make an attempt, the overall probability of at least one success increases to 19%, and with three firms, it increases to 27.1%. With multiple firms participating, our chances of success improve.</p>

<p>At the same time, attracting additional firms becomes increasingly expensive as they risk sharing the reward if several of them succeed. At the same time, attracting additional firms becomes increasingly expensive as they risk sharing the reward if several of them succeed. Consider the example where each attempt costs \$1 million and has a 10% chance of success. For a single firm to participate, the reward needs to be at least \$10 million (to offset the 10% chance of success). For two firms to participate, the reward needs to be higher - around \$10.5 million - because each firm now faces the risk of having to split the reward if both succeed. For three firms, the required reward increases to about \$11.1 million. This pattern continues: each additional firm requires a larger incentive to participate than the last because of the increasing risk of having to share the reward.</p>

<p>This creates a fundamental tradeoff: the more firms that participate, the more likely we are to achieve the innovation’s benefits—whether that’s lives saved by a new vaccine or emissions reduced by green technologies—but increasing this probability becomes increasingly expensive. As a result, setting the right reward size means asking: what is the social value of increasing our chances of achieving these benefits, and how do these compare to the costs? During the COVID-19 pandemic, the massive daily cost of delay meant even small increases in the probability of success had enormous value, justifying efforts to attract many firms (<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211103">Ahuja et al 2021</a>). However, in other cases, the funder may only seek to incentivize a few of the best-suited firms to participate.</p>

    Suppose we want to create a pull mechanism such that the probability that at least one firm succeeds is at least $\theta$. In other words, need to find an $n$ such that $1 - (1-p)^n \geq \theta$. We can rearrange this inequality to express the minimum number of firm entrants needed to reach this probability: 
<!-- -->
    $$ n \geq \frac{\ln(1-\theta)}{\ln(1-p)} $$
<!-- -->
    If the number of entrants $n$ exceeds that value, then the probability of success will exceed that target. As all firms are identical in all respects, the probability of receivng the reward conditional on entering is equal to the probability that any firm succeeds, divided by the number of firms entering. In other words, 
<!-- -->
    $$ \mathbb{P}(win|entry) = \frac{1-(1-p)^n}{n} $$
<!-- -->
    A firm will only enter if its expected revenue exceeds the expected costs ($\mathbb{E}[c]$). For a risk-neutral firm, the expected revenue is simply $\mathbb{P}(win|entry) \cdot X$. As a result, by plugging in the values for $\mathbb{P}(win|entry)$ and $n$ we found above, we find that the required pull size is 
<!-- -->
    $$ X \geq \frac{\ln(1-\theta)}{\theta \cdot \ln(1-p)} \cdot \mathbb{E}[c]$$
 <!-- -->
    Future sections will relax some of these assumptions and build out a complete model.

<h3 id="cost_of_multiple_attempts">b. The Cost of Incentivizing Multiple Attempts</h3>

<p>The more firms that have already entered, the higher the marginal cost to induce an extra firm, because now firms face higher risk of splitting the prize. As the number of firms increases, the marginal cost approaches the cost of each additional attempt. For instance, if the probability of success per attempt is 5% and the present value cost of each attempt is \$1,000,000 then a funder would need to increase the pull size by \$580,000 to move from nine to ten attempts. In contrast, moving from 50 to 51 attempts requires an additional marginal cost of $856,000.</p>

    From the previous section, we know that $X \cdot \frac{1-(1-p)^n}{n} \geq \mathbb{E}[c]$. Through re-arrangement we can find that
    $$ X \geq \frac{n \cdot \mathbb{E}[c]}{1-(1-p)^n}$$

    We need to simply take the derivative of that expression to find $\frac{\mathrm{d}X}{\mathrm{d}n}$, which we find as

    $$\frac{\mathrm{d}X}{\mathrm{d}n} = \mathbb{E}[c] \cdot \frac{1 + (1-p)^n \cdot (n \cdot \ln(1-p) - 1)}{(1-(1-p)^n)^2} $$

    $$ lim_{n \to \infty}(\frac{\mathrm{d}X}{\mathrm{d}n}) = \mathbb{E}[c] $$


</div>

<p>Now we can calculate the reward size needed in order to induce a given level of firm entry. The following graph shows the pull size as a function of the multiple of the cost of innovation, if there was no time delay between private investment and receiving payment. In the real world, including the cost of time will increase costs substantially: as we saw in the previous section, the nominal value will be far higher if revenues are delayed substantially. For example, if an <span class="tooltip-word">innovation attempt<span class="tooltip-text">Remember that an “attempt” in this case does not refer to the cost of an entire research program, which can often involve dozens of research attempts. The cost also only refers to the expected cost of a new attempt at the time of initiating, and not the full cost of seeing an attempt all the way through to completion, since most attempts fail well-before incurring the costs of, e.g. late-stage safety &amp; efficacy trials</span></span> costs \$1 million and each attempt has only a 5% chance of success, then the present value of the incentive needs to be at least \$66 million to get at least an 80% chance of success. If the payments occurred ten years after the research begins (a realistic timeframe for novel drugs or vaccines) and firms have an 8% discount rate, then the nominal value of the incentive will have to be at least $142 million.</p>

<p><em>Note: The expected cost of an attempt (used when considering firm participation) can be substantially lower than the full actualized development costs. For instance, if full development costs are $20 million but have only a 5% chance of being incurred, the expected cost is \$1 million, as stated in the example above. This is one of the reasons pull mechanisms appear very large relative to expected costs.</em></p>

<p><button class="see-more-btn" onclick="toggleDetails('push-pull-details')">Some notes on push v. pull</button></p>
<div id="push-pull-details" class="details-box">
    These large costs seem to beg the question: why not simply pay upfront for innovation (i.e. why not use “push” funding?). After all, paying upfront allows the funder to avoid needing to compensate firms for time delay. This piece is not the venue to get into the complete debate about push versus pull. Suffice to say there are several reasons why pull might be more effective, despite seeming more expensive:
<p></p>
<ol>
    <li> The funder may not be able to identify which firms are the cheapest (i.e. firms have <em> asymmetric information</em>). Since push funding requires the funder to choose firms upfront, push funding may result in rewarding more expensive firms </li>
    <li> The funder may not be able to identify a specific target product in advance, and thus may prefer a pull approach that is open to multiple different kinds of solutions </li>
    <li> Push funding does not create incentives for firms to speedily commercialize their products. Many innovations look good on paper but fail to achieve traction in the market; pull funding could save funders money by avoiding payouts for these “false positives” </li>
</ol>

The complete push v. pull debate deserves far more space than this dropdown can provide. Suffice to say that the need to compensate firms for a lengthy time delay is a reason one might prefer push funding, but other considerations may be decisive in favor of pull depending on the circumstances.

<h2 id="total_costs">5. Total Costs and Cost Effectiveness</h2>

<h3 id="additional_costs">a. Additional Cost Considerations</h3>

<p>Any complete analysis of an innovation incentive program will need to include other necessary costs, beyond those necessary to induce adequate firm entry. In some cases, these additional factors may lower the total necessary cost of the program. These include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Monitoring and verification.</strong> Pull mechanisms involve paying for success. This requires being able to monitor one’s outcome of interest (e.g. verifying sales, adoption, impact on outcome measures). In some cases, these costs will be significant and should be considered as part of the overall costs of the program in addition to the direct cost of the pull reward. </li>
    <li><strong>Costs of designing and implementing the pull fund.</strong> The institution designing and implementing the pull funding program will incur personnel, administrative, and overhead costs. These are likely to be orders of magnitude smaller than the cost of incentivizing innovation. </li>
    <li><strong>Third-party purchases. </strong> Innovations will differ to the extent to which the funder will need to make up the whole market. For some innovations, there will be significant private demand which can be subtracted from the overall market size to calculate the size of the pull fund needed.  Purchases from other agents are not part of the cost to the funder. However, costs paid by other agents that would be unlikely to occur in the absence of the pull mechanism should be considered when appraising the benefits and costs of the intervention. For example, suppose one needs a \$1 billion market (present value) to create at least a 50% probability that a new diagnostic will be invented but there is only \$600 million in private demand. In this case, the needed pull size will only need to be \$400 million.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cost_effectiveness">b. Cost Effectiveness</h3>
<p>To determine the overall cost-effectiveness of a pull mechanism, we compare the total costs to the expected benefits of the target innovation.</p>

<p>Pull mechanisms are unique investments in that funders either receive the social return of successful innovation or, should no firm succeed at innovation, the chance to spend their funds on other opportunities at a later date. The money does not disappear if no one succeeds at innovation.</p>

<p>Two useful metrics for considering cost-effectiveness are the benefit-cost ratio and net present value of the project.</p>

<p>The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) indicates the social value generated per dollar spent. It is computed by dividing the expected benefits by the total costs. A BCR greater than 1 signals that the benefits outweigh the costs.</p>

<strong>Step 1 - Expected Costs and Risks</strong>

<p>
In previous examples, we used this table from <a href="https://curis.ku.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/106806762/IFRO_Report_227.pdf">Jensen 2014</a>  to find the expected cost and risk per innovation attempt. Even though the all-in cost of seeing an attempt through from initiation to success is \$3.4 million, because the supermajority of attempts fail far before the test and approval phases, the expected cost at time of initiation is only \$1.904 million. After discounting using an 8.05% discount rate (to recognize the fact that costs borne in future years count “less” than costs incurred in the present, the “expected cost per attempt” becomes \$1,799,000 with a probability of success of 2.7%.

<strong>Step 2 - Calculating Needed Pull Size</strong>

<p>
$$ X \geq \frac{\ln(1-\theta)}{\theta \cdot \ln(1-p)} \cdot \mathbb{E}[c]$$

We can now plug in these numbers to our formulas shown above, using \$1,799,000 as $\mathbb{E}[c]$ and 0.027 as $p$. The target probability of success $\theta$ is a choice of art, and the following chart shows the needed pull size depending on the choice of the target probability of success.

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <embed style="border: none;" src="./example_sizing.html" dpi="300" width="90%" height="550px" />
  </div>

<strong>Step 3 - Adding in Complications</strong>
<p>

$$ V(X,k) \cdot p \cdot (1-p)^{\frac{n}{k} - 1} \geq \mathbb{E}[c]$$

$$\mathbb{V}(X, k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{1}{i+1} \cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{successes} = i) \cdot X $$

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{successes} = i) = \binom{k-1}{i} \cdot \left(p^{\frac{n}{k}}\right)^i \cdot \left((1-p)^{\frac{n}{k}}\right)^{k-1-i}
$$

$$m \geq \frac{\ln(1-\frac{1-(1-\frac{\theta}{\eta})^{\frac{1}{k}}}{\gamma})}{\ln(1-p)}$$

If one wishes, one can now add in some of the complications from before, such as reasonable guesses about the number of participating firms and the extent to which this innovation is even “possible”. Both of these terms are highly subjective, and should be informed by interviews with industry experts. For this example, let us assume there are at most six firms in the market, with a global possibility parameter of 75% ($\eta$) and a within-firm possibility parameter of 66.67% ($\gamma$) (in other words, there exists only a three-quarters chance that this innovation is possible and, conditional on the innovation being possible, there is only a two-thirds chance that any given pathway to achieve that innovation could work). 
</p>

<em>Note: As a side note, when one adds in these correlations, we do need to adjust the value of the probability of success $p$ conditional on the innovation being possible. If our data says (e.g.) that these trials succeed 2.7% of the time, then the probability that the trials succeed conditional on being possible at all (using our parameters) becomes </em> $0.027 \div \frac{3}{4} \div \frac{2}{3} = 0.054 = 5.4\%$

<p></p>
<strong>Step 4 - Converting into Nominal Terms</strong>

<p>
The above formula gives only the present value to the firm. But it does not tell us exactly how much money one needs to raise. To do so, we need to understand how long this innovation might take. More distant innovations will result in longer lags between research investment and ultimate payout, and thus require larger rewards in order to induce entry. Industry literature and expert interviews can give some bounds on this estimate. In this case, let us assume that research takes eight years from start to finish.
</p>

<p>
The structure of the pull incentive affects the next step. In the case of a prize, once the research target has been achieved, the firm can receive all of the reward. In the case of an advance market commitment (AMC), the payments are structured as per-unit subsidies. For this example, let us assume the incentive is an AMC that lasts for ten years and payments occur contemporaneously with sales. 
</p>

<p>
In this case, we would need to have a rough model of rollout, which can be informed by the rollout of other products in the space. This payment structure will further increase costs, because sales growth tends to take time, which further increases the wedge between initial investment and ultimate payout. 
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <embed style="border: none;" src="./vaccine_rollout.html" dpi="300" width="90%" height="500px" />
  </div>

<p>
At this step, one also needs to include marginal costs of production and add those to the needed subsidy, while subtracting out any private willingness-to-pay. In the case of our methane-reducing vaccines, both the cost of production and private willingness-to-pay might be extremely low (e.g. \$2.25/dose and \$0, respectively). 
</p>

<p>
Consider the above logistic chart of potential rollout. Cognizant that sales made in later years are less valuable to the company in present-value terms than sales made earlier, we can use computers to find the value of a per-unit subsidy such that the present value of all of these future payments exceeds \$207.8 million. To do so, one takes the number of doses projected to be sold each year and discount them (using the firm’s 8.05% discount rate) into “effective number of doses in current-year terms”.

<p>
Then divide the total needed present value (\$207.8 million) by the “effective present value of doses” and add in the \$2.25 to offset the cost of production to get a final answer of \$9.62/dose. We now have a total nominal price tag of \$887 million (multiplying the total subsidized doses by the total nominal cost). If we assume that the funder can earn a risk-free 2% interest rate on the money they put in escrow, the total amount of money they need to commit becomes <strong>\$653.8 million</strong>. Why is this value so much greater than the original \$207.8 million we found? Because the time value of money to the firm (8.05%) far exceeds the interest that the funder can get on the money they put in escrow (2%).

<h3 id="other-considerations">b. Other Considerations</h3>

<h4 id="pipeline">Within and across firm attempts: pipeline approaches to innovation</h4>

<p>The above analysis assumes a competitive market where each firm makes a single attempt. However, this assumption may be unrealistic, as in reality firms tend to make multiple attempts; why go through all the effort hiring researchers and expensive equipment only to make a single attempt?  Suppose research trials have a 2% success rate and a pull designer desires a 50% probability of at least one success: the above formula suggests that the funder now needs to incentivize at least 35 attempts. The notion that 35 attempts will be satisfied by 35 different firms seems unlikely: maybe five firms conducting seven attempts each is more plausible.</p>

<p>As a result, we can consider how the model changes if one imposes constraints on the number of firms that are <span class="tooltip-word">capable of responding<span class="tooltip-text">In reality, there is no “hard cap” on the number of firms that exist in a market. After all, a large incentive can induce new firms to enter. We impose this limit not as a reflection of reality but rather to tractably illustrate the principle</span></span>. Intuitively, this restriction requires firms to initiate multiple attempts each. The marginal cost to the funder to induce that additional attempt will be higher than under the previous one-attempt-per-firm model as a firm now faces a risk of self-competition. Intuitively, the fewer possible firms in the market, the greater the premium the funder must pay.</p>

Consider an extreme case of a monopoly firm. The monopolist receives no additional reward for having multiple successes. As a result, a marginal attempt is only valuable when all other attempts fail (with probability $(1-p)^{n-1}$), but that one additional attempt succeeds (with probability $p$). Thus, we get the value equation of

$$ X \cdot p \cdot (1-p)^{n-1} \geq \mathbb{E}[c]$$

The number of attempts needed to achieve at least a $\theta$ probability of success does not change. As a result, we plug $n \geq \frac{\ln(1-\theta)}{\ln(1-p)}$ into the above equation, producing:

$$ X \geq \frac{1-p}{p \cdot (1-\theta)} \cdot \mathbb{E}[c]$$

We can see that for all $\theta &gt; p$, the needed pull size for a monopolist exceeds the pull size for a competitive market (when $\theta \leq p$, one only needs to induce one attempt so the two cases are identical).
<br />
<br />
In reality, neither a monopolist nor a perfectly fragmented market is likely. Some in-between world is far more probable. The extent of the premium rapidly declines as the number of firms increases. The following section details the math, though one is encouraged to skip to the charts and tables for the intuition.

Assume $k$ firms in the market. Because of the homogeneity assumption, each firm will now undertake $\frac{n}{k}$ attempts. Let us now define $\mathbb{V}(X,k)$ as the present value of the pull size given the number of firms in the market. 

$$ V(X,k) \cdot p \cdot (1-p)^{\frac{n}{k} - 1} \geq \mathbb{E}[c]$$

In the above, a firm's marginal additional attempt is only valuable if the marginal attempt succeeds ($p$) and all other attempts by that firm ($(1-p)^{\frac{n}{k}-1}$) fails.

$$\mathbb{V}(X, k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{1}{i+1} \cdot \mathbb{P}(\text{successes} = i) \cdot X $$

In other words, thev value of winning depends on the number of other firms that are successful. The term $\frac{1}{i+1}$ represents the share of $X$ received by the firm given $i$ other successful firms.

$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{successes} = i) = \binom{k-1}{i} \cdot \left(p^{\frac{n}{k}}\right)^i \cdot \left((1-p)^{\frac{n}{k}}\right)^{k-1-i}
$$

The above equation is simply an expansion of the binomial formula where the number of attempts per firm is $\frac{n}{k}$ and is equivalent to calculating the probability of any specific number of heads when one flips a weighted coin $k-1$ times when the probability of any given flip resolving as heads if $(1-p)^{\frac{n}{k}}$. In cases where the number of attempts is not divisible by the number of firms, we split proportionately. For example, if there are 27 desired attempts and only five firms, three firms will conduct five attempts each, while two firms will conduct six.

In practice, this approach results in a higher needed pull size than the “one attempt per firm” model, but a lower pull size than the monopolist case. Intuitively, the more attempts per firm, the larger the price premium grows. That said, the result tails off so quickly after the monopolist case that this factor is rarely worth considering. For example, if the probability of success per attempt was 6% and the target probability was 50%, having only four firms results in a pull size 8.8% larger than if there were enough firms to have one attempt per firm, but 25% cheaper than if there were only a single firm. However, if the target probability was 66.67% instead, a four firm world requires a 15.8% premium over the one-firm-per-attempt, but a 59.3% discount from a monopolist situation.

<h4 id="correlation-section">Correlated probabilities of success</h4>

<p>The above analysis assumes that all attempts are independent, that is, that different innovation attempts are not related to each other and do not affect each other’s chances of succeeding. This assumption is transparently unrealistic, for two reasons. First, the innovation itself may be impossible (or at least impossible in the near future). No amount of separate attempts would allow ancient Roman scientists to construct a modern computer. This is akin to saying that there is an upper bound on the total probability that at least one attempt succeeds. Second, different attempts all made by the same firm are likely more correlated to each other than they are to attempts made by other firms.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the level of correlation between attempts is unobservable, and designers should use their discretion to incorporate this factor. In general, considering correlation between attempts will raise costs, generally on the magnitude of 10-50%.</p>

We can thus introduce two sources of correlation: a global parameter that reflects the maximum probability of success given an arbitrarily large number of firms and attempts, and a local parameter that reflects the possibility that any given firm could possibly succeed. These changes effectively add an “impossibility ceiling” on the probability of success.

In practice, introducing this two-stage correlation structure has two effects on the total pull size: 1) the marginal cost of increasing the target probability of success rises dramatically and 2) the marginal cost for having a concentrated market with few firms rises concurrently. 

In the following equations, let  represent the global possibility parameter and  be the intra-firm possibility parameter. m is the number of attempts per firm.

Set aside the global parameter for now and let us focus our efforts on the within-firm possibility parameter $\gamma$. 

$$\mathbb{P}_{firm}(success \geq 1) = \gamma \cdot (1-(1-p)^m) $$

The probability that all of a firm's attempts fail is the sum of the probability that the approach is fundamentally infeasible ($1 - \gamma$) and the probability that the approach is feasible ($\gamma$) but all of the attempts fail regardless ($(1-p)^m$). Putting together, one gets $$\mathbb{P}_{firm}(success \geq 1) = 1 - [(1-\gamma) + \gamma \cdot (1-p)^m]$$

This equation simplifies to the previous equation. Now to introduce the global possibility parameter $\eta$.

$$\mathbb{P}_{all}(success \geq 1) = \eta \cdot (1 - [1-\gamma \cdot (1-(1-p)^m)]^k) \geq \theta$$

The goal is to get the probability of success to exceed the target threshold. With the new global possibility parameter, the probability that at least one firm succeeds is the probability that any given firm succeeds conditional on the innovation being possible (from Equation 4.1) multiplied by the possibility $\eta$ that the innovation is at all possible.

$$m \geq \frac{\ln(1-\frac{1-(1-\frac{\theta}{\eta})^{\frac{1}{k}}}{\gamma})}{\ln(1-p)}$$

Algebraic rearrangement of the second equation produces the third. There is no simplified form for the necessary pull size. Instead, one can insert the value of $m$ into the equation for the finite firms, replacing the $\frac{n}{k}$ term that represnts attempts per firm with the value for $m$ found in Equation 4.3.

<p>In practice, introducing correlation substantially increases the needed pull size, as the number of attempts needed to reach the same probability of success increases dramatically.</p>
